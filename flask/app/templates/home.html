      This project started with the purpose of keeping people going through stressful
      hackathons, even when everything seems to go wrong and all the people you were
      meant to work with just want to give up because you are yet to have a good idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope this encourages you to continue participating at hackathons and that
      it won't let you forget how fun coding can be :)
    </p>
    <p>This project was made by using the gitHub API to scrape the commit messages
      from the user upon login and a Sentiment Analysis API to find the user's general
      mood when coding. In addition to this, the app has been extended to a playlist
      to complement the coders' mood. </p>
